T
he morphogenesis checkpoint in budding yeast delays
progression through the cell cycle in response to
stimuli that prevent bud formation. Central to the
checkpoint mechanism is Swe1 kinase: normally inactive,
its activation halts cell cycle progression in G2. We propose
a molecular network for Swe1 control, based on published
observations of budding yeast and analogous control signals
in fission yeast. The proposed Swe1 network is merged with
a model of cyclin-dependent kinase regulation, converted
into a set of differential equations and studied by numerical
simulation. The simulations accurately reproduce the
phenotypes of a dozen checkpoint mutants. Among other
predictions, the model attributes a new role to Hsl1, a kinase
known to play a role in Swe1 degradation: Hsl1 must also be
indirectly responsible for potent inhibition of Swe1 activity.
The model supports the idea that the morphogenesis
checkpoint, like other checkpoints, raises the cell size
threshold for progression from one phase of the cell cycle
to the next.
Introduction
During the cell division cycle, a cell first replicates its hereditary
material (S phase) and then segregates the chromosomes to
the newborn daughter cells (mitosis). Alternation of mitosis
and DNA replication is necessary for the cycle to be successful:
two consecutive rounds of mitosis cause lethal mis-segregation
of the genome, and successive rounds of DNA synthesis
are usually disadvantageous (Enoch and Nurse, 1991). In
molecular terms, the proper order of the events is ensured by
the alternation of different Cdk activities (Morgan 1995).
Cdk activities are subject to multiple controls: they are
activated by binding to cyclins, and they can be inhibited by
tyrosine phosphorylation or by stoichiometric binding with
a Cdk inhibitor (Sic1 in budding yeast). Waves of different
classes of cyclins alternate during the cycle, and the resulting
Cdk–cyclin complexes are responsible for various cell cycle
events. In budding yeast (where the cell-cycle regulating Cdk
is Cdc28), the first complex to arise during the cycle is
Cdc28–Cln3, which senses growth of the cell in G1, followed
by Cdc28–Cln1 and Cdc28–Cln2, which are responsible for
bud initiation and spindle pole body duplication. They are

followed by Cdc28–Clb5 and Cdc28–Clb6, which are
primarily responsible for S phase, and finally by the mitotic
complexes Cdc28–Clb1 and Cdc28–Clb2.
The main transitions of the cell division process—the
onset of DNA replication (Start), entry into mitosis (G2-M
transition), and exit from mitosis—are controlled by surveil-
lance mechanisms, also known as checkpoints (Hartwell and
Weinert, 1989). The G2-M checkpoint plays a major role in
fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), where it forestalls
mitosis until the cell grows to a critical size and properly
replicates its DNA (Nurse, 1999). The molecular events
which control this transition are the inhibitory phosphorylation
of tyrosine-15 of Cdc2 (the fission yeast homologue of Cdc28),
executed by the protein kinase Wee1, and the activating
dephosphorylation of this site, catalyzed by the phosphatase
Cdc25. If DNA is damaged or not properly replicated, the
checkpoint is engaged, Cdc2 is phosphorylated on tyrosine-15,
and cell cycle progression is halted. The inhibitory phos-
phorylation is relieved when DNA is fully replicated or the
damage is repaired (Enoch and Nurse, 1991).
Budding yeast contains homologues of Wee1 and Cdc25,
known respectively as Swe1 kinase (Booher et al., 1993) and
Mih1 phosphatase (Russell et al., 1989). But in budding
yeast, Mih1 and Swe1 are not used to check cell size, nor are

they involved in monitoring DNA replication, as evidenced
by the fact that cells containing a mutant form of Cdc28
lacking the tyrosine phosphorylation site are still perfectly
viable in the presence of inhibitors of DNA synthesis (Amon
et al., 1992; Sorger and Murray, 1992). Recently, Lew and
coworkers have shown in an elegant series of papers that
these tyrosine phosphorylation–dephosphorylation reactions
in budding yeast are involved in a different kind of check-
point, called the morphogenesis checkpoint (for review see
Lew, 2000). This surveillance mechanism halts cell cycle
progression when bud formation is impaired, which is a
plausible event for yeast cells growing in natural conditions
because several external stimuli (such as heat shock and os-
motic shock) are able to arrest or delay the formation of a
bud (Sia et al., 1998). By arresting or delaying cell cycle pro-
gression, the morphogenesis checkpoint prevents formationMathematical model of the morphogenesis checkpoint | Ciliberto et al. 1245

and Cdc28–Clb2 is repressed, and vice versa in S-G2-M. Cln-
dependent kinase activity pushes the engine from G1 to S-G2-M by
inactivating Sic1 and Cdh1. Cln synthesis turns on when the cell
grows to a critical size, because Mass activates SBF. The transition
from S-G2-M back to G1 is driven by Cdc20, which targets Clb2 for
degradation and (indirectly) activates Cdh1. For further details, see

of dinucleated cells, which are less viable than mononucle-
ated cells (Sia et al., 1996). The arrest is not complete; after
several hours, unbudded cells undergo mitosis (called “adap-
tation”) and become dinucleate (Sia et al., 1996).
In this paper, we propose a molecular network for the
morphogenesis checkpoint, based largely on Lew’s work
(Lew, 2000), and we translate it into a set of differential
equations. Our main goal is to explain the observed proper-
ties of cells under checkpoint-free and checkpoint-induced
conditions in terms of the temporal dynamics of the under-
lying molecular regulatory system. The model provides a
common framework for describing many diverse features of
the checkpoint; not only G2 delay, but also adaptation and
cell death. The model also suggests a number of experi-
ments that would be especially revealing about the molecu-
lar regulatory system.
Results
A mathematical model
In Table I and online supplemental material (Experimental
basis of the model, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/
content/full/jcb.200306139/DC1), we summarize the ex-
perimental results that support a hypothetical molecular
mechanism for the morphogenesis checkpoint, based on
posttranslational modification of Swe1. Obviously, the
checkpoint mechanism cannot be separated from the whole
network of cell-cycle regulatory proteins. Cdc28–Clb2 is the
key regulator of mitosis and as such it is the main target of
Swe1 kinase activity, but there are other connections. For
example, the transcription factor SBF controls Swe1 expres-
sion as well as Cln1-2 expression; and bud formation,
needed for Hsl1 activation, is due to Cdc28–Cln1-2. There-
fore, if we want to model the morphogenesis checkpoint, we
must start with a model of the cell cycle engine.
Cell cycle engine. Tyson and Novak (2001) have pro-
posed a simplified version (Fig. 1) of a model by Chen et al.
(2000) of the budding yeast cell cycle. In the Tyson-Novak
model, Cln1, Cln2, Clb5, and Clb6 are lumped together as
“Cln”, and Clb1 and Clb2 are lumped together as “Clb2”.
Cln synthesis is due to SBF, and therefore is a function of
cell size (Dirick et al., 1995). Cln-dependent kinase activity
induces degradation of Sic1, and initiates DNA synthesis
(via Clb5-6). Moreover, Cln-dependent kinase activity inac-
tivates Cdh1, permitting Clb2 level to rise. Cdc28–Clb2 ac-
tivity, relieved from Sic1 and Cdh1 inhibition, turns on its
own transcription through Mcm1, and turns off Cln tran-
scription by inhibiting SBF. The cell enters into M phase,
and Cdc28–Clb2 starts a negative feedback loop by activat-
ing a putative intermediate enzyme, and by enhancing
Cdc20 transcription. The ultimate effect of the loop is to ac-
tivate the anaphase promoting complex, which degrades
Clb2 and drives the cell out of mitosis.
In addition to Mcm1-dependent transcription of CLB2,
we assume a background transcription rate, independent of
Mcm1. After Tyson and Novak (2001), we assume that the
rate of Clb2 synthesis increases with cell size (M), and even-
tually saturates. This relationship mimics the accumulation
of Clb2 in the nucleus as the cell grows. To this engine, we
now graft our mechanism for the morphogenesis checkpoint
(Fig. 2).
Hsl1-Hsl7-Bud. To keep the model simple, while preserv-
ing its main biological properties, we do not take into account
any spatial features; first, we assume simply that bud forma-
tion is turned on by the Clns (see Other rules). Second, we do
not keep track of Hsl1 synthesis, degradation, and activation.
Because Hsl1 activation depends on bud presence, we assume
that when the bud is formed, Hsl1 is able to “modify” Swe1
(Swe1M denotes the modified form of Swe1). The nature of
this modification is not clear, as Swe1 does not appear to be a
substrate for Hsl1 (Cid et al., 2001; Theesfeld et al., 2003).
Whatever the modification may be, we assume that it does
not affect Swe1 stability but makes Swe1 inactive (0.5% of
the fully active form). Finally, we ignore Hsl7 because Hsl1
catalyzes the rate-limiting step for Swe1 modification (Mc-
Millan et al., 1999a). Many other proteins are involved in this
step (septins, Kcc4, Gin4, Cla4, and Nap1), but again, as a
first approximation, we ignore them.
Swe1. Swe1 does not play a major role during the normal
cell cycle of S. cerevisiae even though it is able to phosphory-
late Cdc28 on tyrosine-19 (Booher et al., 1993). The cell cy-
cle is perfectly normal in swe1 (Booher et al., 1993). None-
theless, Swe1 can affect cell cycle progression, as swe1 cells
are slightly smaller than wild-type cells (Harvey and Kellogg,
2003), and Swe1 overexpression (GAL-SWE1, wild-type
gene controlled by a GAL promoter) leads to a G2 block and
very elongated buds (Booher et al., 1993).1246 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 163, Number 6, 2003
Figure 2. The Swe1 box. Swe1 can be present in four different forms
during the cell cycle: unchanged (Swe1), phosphorylated by Cdc28–
Clb2 (PSwe1); or modified by Hsl1 (Swe1M) or both (PSwe1M). The
doubly modified form we assume to be less stable than the others.
The unphosphorylated, unmodified form of Swe1 is assumed to be
most active in phosphorylating Cdc28–Clb2. Cdc28 is dephosphor-
ylated by Mih1. We assume that Cdc28–Clb2 phosphorylates and
activates Mih1, and MAPK (Mpk1) inactivates Mih1. The asterisk
identifies the more active form of a protein.
Cdc28–Clb2 phosphorylates Swe1 in vitro (McMillan et al.,
2002), and we assume that Cdc28–Clb2 catalyzes the same re-
action in vivo (we call the phosphorylated form PSwe1). We
assume that PSwe1 has 10% of Swe1 kinase activity.
Swe1 is degraded by proteasomes, after polyubiquitina-
tion by the Skp1–Cdc53–F-box protein complex (Kaiser et
al., 1998). We assume that Swe1, like other substrates of this
complex, must be phosphorylated in order to be ubiqui-
tinated. The phosphorylation we assume to be necessary but
not sufficient (i.e., PSwe1 is as stable as Swe1). Efficient deg-
radation of Swe1, we assume, requires modification by both
Cdc28–Clb2 and Hsl1 (i.e., PSwe1M is both catalytically
inactive and highly unstable).
In the model, Hsl1 and Cdc28–Clb2 act along the same
degradation pathway, each introducing a different posttrans-
lational modification in Swe1. Either modification alone
renders Swe1 less active, whereas both are needed to make it
unstable. Based on recent data (McMillan et al., 2002), we
assume that these two modifications can occur in either or-
der, although Hsl1 acts first in wild-type cells. The four dif-
ferent forms (Swe1, Swe1M, PSwe1, and PSwe1M) com-
prise the “Swe1 box” in Fig. 2.
The antagonistic relationship between Cdc28–Clb2 and
Swe1 is at the core of our model of the morphogenesis
checkpoint. When the checkpoint is induced, Swe1 phos-
phorylates and inhibits Cdc28–Clb2 (Booher et al., 1993).
(Swe1 can also function as a stoichiometric inhibitor of
Cdc28–Clb2 [McMillan et al., 1999b], but we do not keep
track of this effect in the model.) On the other hand,
Cdc28–Clb2 down-regulates Swe1 in three ways. By phos-
phorylating Swe1, it reduces Swe1 activity and prepares
Swe1 for degradation. In addition, Cdc28–Clb2 inhibits the
transcription factor, SBF, and thereby shuts off synthesis of
Swe1. If Cdc28–Clb2 successfully down-regulates Swe1,
then the cell proceeds into mitosis. If Swe1 successfully in-
hibits Cdc28–Clb2, then the cell arrests in G2 phase.
Mih1. In frog egg extracts (where the homologues of Mih1
and Cdc28–Clb2 are called Cdc25 and M-phase promoting
factor [MPF]), Cdc25 has been shown to be involved in a
positive feedback loop with MPF, whereby MPF activates
Cdc25 by phosphorylation, and Cdc25 activates MPF by de-
phosphorylating it (Izumi et al., 1992). Although there are no
data to confirm the presence of such a feedback loop in S. cere-
visiae, we assume it is operational in our model.
MAPK pathway. When bud formation fails, Hsl1 is un-
able to down-regulate Swe1 activity. In addition, a second
signaling pathway, operating through a MAPK (Mpk1) is
thought to inhibit Mih1 and thereby alter the ratio of Mih1
to Swe1 activities (Harrison et al., 2001). Rather than intro-
duce a full MAPK pathway, we simply assume that the rate
constants characterizing Cdc28–Clb2 dephosphorylation by
Mih1 are decreased 10-fold as an effect of Mpk1 activation,
in response to bud failure.
Equations and parameters. The wiring diagrams of Figs.
1 and 2 have been translated into a set of ordinary differen-
tial equation (Table S1, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/
content/full/jcb.200306139/DC1) using mass-action kinet-
ics for the most part. Where we use Michaelis-Menten ki-
netics, we are treating the posttranslational modification as a
“Goldbeter-Koshland switch” (Goldbeter and Koshland,
1981), which is a convenient and reasonable way to model
information processing in signal transduction pathways. For
transcriptional control of Cdc20 synthesis by Cdc28–Clb2,
we use a Hill function for convenience; other assumptions
would work just as well. The parameter values used in our
simulations are shown in Table S2, available at http://
www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200306139/DC1. Degra-
dation rates for the four different forms of Swe1 have been
computed from Sia et al. (1998), whereas those parameter
values relative to Fig. 1 are derived from Tyson and Novak
(2001). All other parameter values for Fig. 2 have been cho-
sen to fit the experimental data summarized in Table I.
Other rules. A nontrivial aspect of modeling gene net-
works is to link physiological observations with molecular
states of the model. Our variables are concentrations, but
bud formation, nuclear division (ND) and cell death are the
experimental observables. We have adopted the following six
rules to relate our calculations to experimental observations:
(1) cell size increases exponentially (M  M0et,   spe-
cific growth rate). Cell division (M → M/2) occurs when
Cdc28–Clb2 decreases below a threshold, [Clb2]  0.2; (2)
we introduce a variable [BE] that represents the extent of
phosphorylation of proteins targeted by Cdc28–Cln. We as-
sume that a bud is formed ([BUD]  1) and Hsl1 is acti-
vated when [BE] increases above a threshold value (0.6).
The bud is removed ([BUD]  0) and Hsl1 is inactivated
when the cell divides. We model hsl1 by setting khsl1  0;
(3) the MAPK signal is modeled by reducing the activity of
Mih1 by 90% (kmih  0.5, kmih  0.05); (4) most experi-
ments report the percentage of cells that undergo ND as a
function of time. Because our model is deterministic, all
cells divide at the same time. We identify the experimental
time when 50% of the cells have undergone ND with the
time in the model when anaphase occurs, i.e., when Cdc20Mathematical model of the morphogenesis checkpoint | Ciliberto et al. 1247
is activated (increases above a threshold value of 0.3); (5) ex-
perimentally, cell synchronization is obtained by treating
cells for 2–3 h with -factor, and then releasing them from
the block. We simulate this experiment by allowing growth
for 120 min at one half the specific growth rate of normal
cells, and setting SBF activity to 0, so that CLN and SWE1
are not transcribed (Sia et al., 1996). The variables at the
end of the 120 min simulation are used as the initial condi-
tions for the ND timing experiment. In some experiments,
synchronization was obtained by elutriation. In this case, we
choose our initial conditions at the minimum mass value of
a regular cell cycle; and (6) we use the following rule to de-
termine whether the cell is viable or not: a mononucleated
cell (dinucleated cell) is dead if its size exceeds four times
(five times) the size of a wild-type cell at division.
Kinetic data in cdc24ts background strains
In the laboratory, the morphogenesis checkpoint can be in-
duced by treating cells with inhibitors of actin polymeriza-
tion (Latrunculin-A [McMillan et al., 1998]), by expressing
mutations that interfere with actin polymerization (tpm1
[McMillan et al., 1998]), or with bud formation in general
(cdc24ts [Lew and Reed, 1995]). In this paper, we address
only experiments using cdc24ts mutants (Sia et al., 1996,
1998; McMillan et al., 1999a). A summary of the experi-
mental data used to constrain the model is presented in Ta-
ble I, together with the corresponding simulation results.
The effect of the morphogenesis checkpoint is commonly
measured as a delay of ND in cdc24ts mutants relative to
CDC24 control cells (Lew and Reed, 1995). In most experi-
ments, yeast cells are synchronized by -factor arrest and re-
lease, and then, while the cells are growing at the restrictive
temperature, the time of the first ND is measured (Sia et al.,
1996). ND occurs much later in cdc24ts cells at the restric-
tive temperature (checkpoint invoked) than in CDC24 cells
(checkpoint silent). The delay depends, of course, on what
other mutations are introduced into the cdc24ts and CDC24
strains (Table I).
The basic mutant, cdc24ts at the restrictive temperature, is
unable to develop a bud; nevertheless, it undergoes ND 135–
165 min after release from -factor (Sia et al., 1996; Mc-
Millan et al., 1999a). In other words, the morphogenesis
“checkpoint” in this mutant is not very tight; after 2–3 h the
cell adapts to it (Sia et al., 1996). The checkpoint depends on
Swe1 because cdc24ts swe1 does not show any delay of ND
compared with wild type (Sia et al., 1996). Mih1 is necessary
for adaptation because cdc24ts mih1 is irreversibly blocked
in G2 (Sia et al., 1996). On the other hand, cdc24ts hsl1
does not show a phenotype more severe than cdc24ts, suggest-
ing that Hsl1 is already inactive in cdc24ts (McMillan et al.,
1999a); not surprisingly because septins, required for full ac-
tivation of Hsl1, are not properly organized in this mutant.
Finally, we want to explore mutants where Swe1 is overex-
pressed. Swe1 production can be made constitutive by cou-
pling the SWE1 gene to either the GAL or GAP promoter.
(Transcriptional efficiency is lower from the GAP promoter
than from the GAL promoter.) GAL-SWE1 is blocked in G2
phase even when the morphogenesis checkpoint is not active
(Booher et al., 1993). In cdc24ts GAP-SWE1, ND is delayed
(118 min) but not as much as in cdc24ts cells (Sia et al.,
Figure 3. Time courses of mass and concentrations during the
cycle of wild-type cells. Numerical solution of equations in Table S1,
given the parameter values and initial conditions from Table S2.
Because Cdc28 is present in excess and binds quickly to cyclins,
there are no free cyclins in the model: a curve marked by a cyclin,
such as Cln, always refers to the concentration of the relevant
complex with Cdc28, such as [Cdc28–Cln]. Swe1T refers to total
Swe1 concentration. The concentration of the phosphorylated form
of Swe1 is negligible and not depicted. The asterisk identifies the
more active form of a protein.
1996). Clearly, transcriptional control of Swe1 synthesis is
not necessary for a working morphogenesis checkpoint, but
the length of the delay depends sensitively on the level of
Swe1 expression. This sensitivity is even more evident in
cdc24ts SWE1-2X and cdc24ts SWE1–4X mutants (McMillan
et al., 1999a), where ND occurs much later (over 5 h in
both cases) than in cdc24ts (135–165 min; Sia et al., 1996,
1998). Actually, the system is sensitive to the ratio of Mih1
to Swe1 rather than to the absolute value of Swe1 expres-
sion, as shown in an elegant experiment by Sia et al. (1996).
They altered systematically the Mih1/Swe1 ratio by creating
diploid strains (MIH1–mih1 and mih1–mih1) in a back-
ground homozygous for SWE1 and cdc24ts. They repeated
the same experiment, this time altering SWE1 dosage in a
diploid strain homozygous for MIH1 and cdc24ts. In these
four mutants, the delay of ND is shown to increase with the
ratio of active Swe1 to active Mih1 (Sia et al., 1996). We

wild type, mih1, and hsl1. Although Swe1 is able to
phosphorylate Cdc28–Clb2 and it is transcribed earlier than
Clb2, the morphogenesis checkpoint is not operational dur-
ing normal cell division. How does the model explain this ap-
parent contradiction? Fig. 3 shows that, as soon as bud
formation occurs, most of the active Swe1 is modified by
Hsl1 into Swe1M and therefore inactivated. Cdc28–Clb2
rises rapidly and phosphorylates Swe1M, converting it into
PSwe1M, which is rapidly degraded. The time course of to-
tal Swe1 (Swe1T) agrees with published data (Sia et al.,1248 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 163, Number 6, 2003

1998). Concentration of the phosphorylated unmodified
form (PSwe1) is negligible during a wild-type cell cycle, ac-
cording to the model. A similar timing of Swe1 redistribu-
tion among its four forms occurs in mih1 (unpublished
data), because Swe1 never gets a chance to phosphorylate
Cdc28–Clb2. On the other hand, in hsl1 (Fig. 4), Swe1 fol-
lows a completely different path in the Swe1 box (Fig. 2). Be-
cause the left part of the box is unavailable, Swe1 oscillates
between its active form and its phosphorylated form. Total
Swe1 undergoes small amplitude oscillations because Cdc28–
Clb2 transiently inhibits its transcription factor, SBF, but it
does not undergo large amplitude oscillations, as in wild type
and mih1, because Swe1 is never transformed into the
highly unstable form (PSwe1M) in hsl1 (McMillan et al.,
1999a). Although this redistribution of Swe1 among its four
possible forms is completely different from wild type and
mih1, the overall timing of cell division is not affected.
Even though Cdc28–Clb2 is inhibited, it accumulates
enough active form to switch on its transcription, to activate
Mih1, and eventually to phosphorylate and inhibit Swe1.

dence in Cross et al. (2002), we assume that Clb2 transcrip-
tion accounts for two thirds of the total Clb1 Clb2 tran-
scription, whereas Clb1 transcription is the remaining one
third. Hence, in clb2 we reduce Clb transcription rate

we get similar qualitative results (Fig. 5): hsl1 clb2 cells
are 21% larger than mih1 clb2 cells. The reason why
mih1 clb2 shows a less severe phenotype is that Hsl1 cre-
ates inactive Swe1M. This way, even though only Clb1 is
transcribed, it is enough to lead the cell into mitosis. On the
other hand, in hsl1 clb2, there is a battle between Swe1
and Cdc28–Clb1, which is initially won by Swe1 because it
is transcribed first. Clb1 transcription is initially kept low,
the cell is stuck in G2 and increases in size. However, an in-
creasing amount of Clb1 accumulates in the nucleus as the
cell becomes larger, and eventually it is able to transform
Swe1 to its inactive phosphorylated form PSwe1, and to lead
the cell through mitosis.

alone is sufficient to help Cdc28–Clb2 against Swe1, whereas
the double mutant is inviable. In the model, we obtain a
similar result (Fig. 6). Comparing the double mutant with
hsl1 (Fig. 4), we see that, without any help from Mih1 and
Hsl1, Cdc28–Clb2 is unable to win against Swe1. As a re-
sult, the cell is blocked in G2; it grows very large and dies.

the dynamics of the system (Sia et al., 1996). To model
GAP-SWE1, we set ks,swe  0 and ks,sweC  0.001. In this
case, for GAP-SWE1 cells, ND occurs at the same time as in
wild-type cells, but for GAP-SWE1 cdc24ts cells, ND occurs
35 min later. On the other hand, GAL-SWE1 has a more
severe phenotype, which can be reproduced by increasing
still more the rate of SWE1 transcription (Table I).

core of the morphogenesis checkpoint: if Swe1 (Mih1) pre-
vails, the checkpoint is (is not) operational. Sia et al. (1996)
investigated thoroughly the effect of altering the ratio in dip-
loid strains, and discovered that ND increases with [Swe1]/
[Mih1]. Simulations are in agreement with experimental data
(Fig. 8). (This experiment was performed on diploid cells.
We assume that the biochemical parameters are the same in

tion rate as the haploid A, whereas transcription rate for the

Parameter analysis
A thorough analysis of parameter space exceeds the aim of
this work, but it is possible to investigate the behavior of the
model to changes in parameter values of special biological
interest (see Materials and methods). We choose not to vary

the kinetic constants of the cell cycle engine (Fig. 1) because
they are based on a different set of experimental data (Tyson
and Novak, 2001). Nor do we question the assumptions
that Cdc28–Clb2 down-regulates Swe1 synthesis (by inacti-
vating SBF) and up-regulates its degradation (phosphory-
lated Swe1 is a better substrate for ubiquitinylation), which
are well founded experimentally (Sia et al., 1996, 1998). In
contrast, we have made several assumptions for which there
is no experimental evidence in budding yeast: that Swe1 ac-
tivity is reduced by Hsl1-dependent modification and by
Cdc28–Clb2-dependent phosphorylation, and that Mih1
activity is increased by Cdc28–Clb2-dependent phosphory-
lation. Three main questions can be formulated concerning

these assumptions. (1) How much activity can be given to
Swe1M (rate constant kswe) as opposed to the fully active
form, Swe1 (kswe)? (2) Is Swe1 inactivation by Cdc28–Clb2
needed? In other words, what is the maximum activity that
can be assigned to PSwe1 (kswe)? (3) Is Mih1 activation by
Cdc28–Clb2 required? Has the activity of the nonphos-
phorylated form of Mih1 (kmih) to be smaller than the activ-
ity assigned to Mih1* (kmih)?
Swe1M. To determine how much Swe1M activity is tol-
erated by the model, we increased the rate constant kswe.
The second parameter to be varied is the Mih1* rate con-
stant kmih, which controls the reverse reaction (dephosphor-
ylation) on the same substrate, Cdc28–Clb2. Mih1 back-
ground rate constant kmih is set to kmih/10. Results (Fig. 9
A) show that already for kswe  0.1 (5% of Swe1 activity) it
is impossible to reproduce the 13 different genotypes. In-
deed, a more detailed analysis (Fig. 9 B) shows that kswe can
be maximum 1.75% of kswe. Notice in Fig. 9 A that a much
larger region of the parameter space (where kswe reaches
20% of kswe) fits 12 genotypes, the missing one being always
due to the fact that the size of clb2 hsl1 fails to exceed the
size of clb2 mih1. This is not surprising, because as soon
as some activity is given to Swe1M, it becomes harder for
Cdc28–Clb2 to overcome Swe1 in clb2 mih1 mutants,
whereas it has no effect on clb2 hsl1 where Swe1M is not
present. We conclude that these unpublished data put a se-
vere constraint on the activity of Swe1.
PSwe1 and Mih1. A second two-parameter analysis was
performed to investigate the requirements of activation of
Mih1 by Cdc28–Clb2 and inactivation of Swe1 by Cdc28–
Clb2. First, we want to know whether Swe1 inactivation
alone can be sufficient. The positive feedback between
Cdc28–Clb2 and Mih1 is eliminated by assigning the same
activity to Mih1 and Mih1* (i.e., kmih  kmih). Their com-
mon value is the first parameter to be varied. The second pa-
rameter is kswe, the activity assigned to PSwe1, whereas
Swe1 activity (kswe) is kept constant. As kswe approaches
kswe  2 (Table S2), Swe1 regulation disappears. If any
combination of these two parameters can fit all 13 geno-
types, we conclude that, for those particular parameter val-
ues, the positive feedback loop between Mih1 and Cdc28–
Clb2 is not needed. As shown in Fig. 9 C, such a parameter
region exists.
Second, we are interested in the possibility that neither the
positive feedback between Cdc28–Clb2 and Mih1 nor the
negative effect of Cdc28–Clb2 on Swe1 is present. This pos-
sibility indeed exists for kmih  kmih  1.5 and kswe 
kswe  2 (Fig. 9 C).
In Fig. 9 D, we show that when both Swe1 and Mih1 are
regulated (the two parameters varied in this analysis are kswe
and kmih, whereas kswe  kswe/10 and kmih  kmih/10), the
model is consistent with the data on all 13 genotypes for kmih/
kswe  1.5. Parameter analysis (unpublished data) reveals that
this region of consistency is 50% larger than in the com-
pletely unregulated model (i.e., kmih  kmih and kswe  kswe).
For this reason, we prefer a model in which both Swe1 and
Mih1 activities are affected by phosphorylation by Cdc28–
Clb2. In addition, this preference is consistent with known
properties of Swe1 and Mih1 homologues in fission yeast
(Tang et al., 1993) and Xenopus laevis (Izumi et al., 1992).

genotypes (to within 20% of experimental results) changes with

Summarizing, parameter analysis shows that, for our
model to be consistent with the data in Table I, Swe1M has
to be less active than Swe1, but phosphorylation-dependent
inactivation of Swe1 and activation of Mih1, although
present in the model, can be relaxed.
Discussion
When bud formation is impaired, the morphogenesis check-
point delays ND to allow for a bud to be formed. The mo-
lecular mechanism underlying this G2 delay relies on the
antagonism between Swe1 and Cdc28–Clb2. These two
protein kinases inhibit each other, and engagement of the
checkpoint depends on the outcome of their fight. During a
normal cell cycle, Cdc28–Clb2 is able to overcome Swe1 ac-
tivity, whereas when bud formation is impaired, Swe1 is sta-
bilized and active, and the cell cycle is delayed in G2 phase.
The morphogenesis checkpoint inhibits the activity of
Cdc28–Clb2 in two different ways. First, because bud for-
mation is impaired, Hsl1 cannot act to inhibit Swe1 and to
label it for degradation. Moreover, if actin cannot polymer-
ize, then a second inhibitory signal impinges on the cell cy-
cle through a MAPK pathway, whose ultimate effect is to al-
ter the ratio of activities of Mih1 and Swe1 (by inactivating
Mih1, or possibly by activating Swe1). Reviewing the cur-
rent literature, we have formulated a hypothesis (wiring dia-
gram) of the way these genes and proteins interact.
The main objective of our analysis is to verify whether the
proposed mechanism can reproduce in quantitative detail the
relevant experimental data. Because intuition and qualitative
arguments are inadequate to predict the behavior of the com-
plex network controlling yeast cell cycle dynamics (Fig. 1)
and the morphogenesis checkpoint (Fig. 2), we have tried to
put this problem in a rigorous mathematical context.Mathematical model of the morphogenesis checkpoint | Ciliberto et al. 1251
Model’s assumptions
The molecular network controlling yeast cell cycle dynamics
has been studied in detail (Chen et al., 2000), and the wiring
diagram we use to describe it is simple but effective. On the
other hand, the network we propose for the morphogenesis
checkpoint is based on three assumptions that have not been
experimentally verified: (1) Swe1 is inactivated when phos-
phorylated by Cdc28–Clb2; (2) Cdc28–Clb2 and Mih1 ac-
tivate each other (a positive feedback loop); and (3) Swe1 is
inactivated by a posttranslational modification introduced
(indirectly) by Hsl1.
Performing a parameter analysis to investigate the extent
to which these assumptions can be relaxed, we discovered
that the first and second are not necessary to explain the
phenotypes of the checkpoint mutants we are studying. This
result is somehow surprising because assumptions 1 and 2
are based on clear experimental evidence in X. laevis and S.
pombe. It is possible that these assumptions will be needed in
the future, when more experiments characterizing the mor-
phogenesis checkpoint must be taken into account. We de-
cided to include them in the basal parameter set, because of
analogies with other organisms and because these assump-
tions make the model more robust.
As for the third assumption, parameter analysis shows that
it cannot be relaxed. In particular, D.J. Lew (personal com-
munication) showed that clb2 hsl1 cells are larger than
clb2 mih1 cells. This observation poses a strict constraint
on the activity of Swe1M, the Hsl1-modified form. Were
this constraint ignored, the other data in Table I would per-
mit a larger activity for Swe1M. Nonetheless, even without
this constraint some regulation of Swe1M activity is re-
quired, as other genotypes fail when Swe1M activity reaches
20% of Swe1 activity. Summarizing, our model predicts that
Hsl1 indirectly inactivates Swe1 activity.
The size difference between clb2 hsl1 and clb2 mih1
plays a crucial role in constraining parameter values of the
model. For the basal parameter set we propose, clb2 hsl1
cells are only 21% larger than clb2 mih1 cells. The size
differential cannot be made much larger without bringing
the model into contradiction with some other property
of the mutant set. Most parameter changes away from the
basal set reduce the size differential and quickly bring the
model’s prediction below our acceptance threshold (size ra-
tio 1.15). Given the importance of this observation in
constraining the model, we suggest that the size ratio of
these two mutants be measured accurately.
Model’s behavior
According to the model, Swe1 can be present in four differ-
ent forms, and the way Swe1 is distributed among these
forms depends on whether the checkpoint is invoked or not.
In wild-type cells, the morphogenesis checkpoint is normally
switched off because as soon as the bud is formed Hsl1 is
activated and Swe1 is converted into the inactive form,
Swe1M. If HSL1 is deleted, the unmodified Swe1 is able to
phosphorylate and inactivate Cdc28. In this case, dephos-
phorylation of Cdc28 (i.e., the presence of Mih1) becomes
necessary. On the other hand, if MIH1 is deleted, Swe1 can
still be converted into the doubly modified form (PSwe1M)
and degraded. This basic difference between mih1 and
hsl1 is particularly evident in the double mutants clb2
hsl1 and clb2 mih1. These cells experience a G2 delay
because they rely on Clb1 alone to enter mitosis. In hsl1
clb2 the delay lasts longer than in mih1 clb2, because
Swe1 cannot be converted into its modified inactive form
Swe1M. Not surprisingly, when both HSL1 and MIH1 are
deleted, the cell is blocked in G2.
These behaviors set the stage for understanding the mor-
phogenesis checkpoint. A cdc24ts cell has a similar, but
milder, phenotype than a mih1 hsl1 cell, as we assume
that the signal transduction pathway operating through
Mpk1 does not completely inhibit Mih1. Therefore, the G2
block in mih1 hsl1 becomes a G2 delay in cdc24ts. After a
time the checkpoint-induced cell (cdc24ts) undergoes adapta-
tion, i.e., ND without bud formation. The selective advan-
tages of this control loop are clear: becoming dinucleate is to
be avoided, if possible, but it is better than death.
Bifurcation diagrams
The morphogenesis checkpoint acts like a “governor” to the
cell cycle engine, slowing progression through the cell cycle
when a particular danger signal (failure to bud) is perceived.
To understand the relationship between the engine and its
governor, it is useful to introduce the notion of a bifurcation
diagram. In Fig. 10, we plot Cdc28–Clb2 activity (the state
of the engine) as a function of cell size (the motive force for
cell cycle progression in yeast; see Bifurcation analysis, avail-
able at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200306139/
DC1; Tyson et al., 2001, 2002). Under normal conditions
(Fig. 10 A), the Cdc28-control system has two characteristic
states: a stable steady state (at small size) and a stable oscilla-
tory state (at large size). A small newborn cell is attracted to
the stable steady state of low Cdc28–Clb2 activity; kept low
by active Cdh1 and Sic1 (Fig. 1). The cell is trapped in G1
because it is too small to warrant a new round of DNA repli-
cation and division. When the cell grows to a critical size
(Fig. 10 A, mass  1), the stable steady state is lost, and the
cell cycle engine begins an oscillation that drives Cdc28–
Clb2 to larger activity. The cell replicates its DNA and
enters mitosis. The mitotic state is intrinsically unstable, be-
cause high levels of Cdc28–Clb2 turn on Cdc20, which de-
stroys Cdc28’s cyclin partner. As Cdc28 activity drops, the
cell divides and the control system is reset to the domain of
the stable steady state. The duration of the budded phase
(S-G2-M) is fixed at 60 min, the time it takes to complete
one oscillation. The duration of G1 phase is variable, de-
pending on growth rate and asymmetry of division.
When the morphogenesis checkpoint is invoked (no bud),
active Swe1 creates a second stable steady state of the cell cy-
cle engine at intermediate Cdc28–Clb2 activity (higher than
the G1 steady state, lower than the peak of the oscillation;
Fig. 10 B). Cdh1 and Sic1 are gone, Cdc28–Cln activity is
high, and Cdc28–Clb2 activity is depressed by Swe1-depen-
dent tyrosine-phosphorylation. High activity of Cdc28–Cln
drives the cell into DNA synthesis, but low activity of
Cdc28–Clb2 is insufficient for mitosis. Hence, the interme-
diate steady state corresponds to a cell stuck in G2. A new-
born daughter cell will grow to mass  1 and enter S phase,
as usual. But then it arrests in G2 phase until it grows large
enough to bypass the G2 arrest and enter mitosis. The delay1252 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 163, Number 6, 2003
will be 2–3 h, depending on growth rate and critical mass at
the end of the G2-arrested state. When the cell reaches this
size (Fig. 10 B, mass  2), it adapts to the checkpoint, un-
dergoes ND, and becomes dinucleate (the cell cannot divide
because it never made a bud). At this point the model makes
a noteworthy prediction. Because the engine is still in the os-
cillatory domain, it will pause only briefly in G1, then rerep-
licate its DNA and enter mitosis, becoming tetraploid (Sia et
al., 1996). To see the predicted shortening of G1 phase, this
experiment is best done at slow growth rates, for which the
duration of G1 phase is usually long.
Figure 10. Bifurcation diagrams for the cell cycle engine. We plot
Cdc28–Clb2 activity, representative of the state of the cell cycle
control system, against cell mass, M, which is the driving force for
progression through the cell cycle. That is, for a fixed value of M,
we solve the differential equations in Table S1 until the control
system reaches a stable, self-maintaining state, which is either a steady
state (no further change in activities of the regulatory proteins) or an
oscillatory state (perfectly repeated fluctuations of their activities).
Horizontal bars are placed at the Cdc28–Clb2 level characteristic of
steady states, and vertical arrows represent the range of fluctuations
of Cdc28–Clb2 activity in an oscillatory state. These diagrams are
schematic cartoons; for accurately computed bifurcation diagrams,
see online supplemental material (Bifurcation analysis) and Fig. S1.
Notice the axes are scaled logarithmically. Because we assume cells
grow exponentially, equal distances along the log(mass) axis repre-
sent equal intervals of time. Along the log(activity) axis we associate
low activity with G1, intermediate activity with S-G2, and high
activity with M phase. (A) Checkpoint silent. The bold dashed line is
a cell-cycle trajectory: as the cell grows, the Cdc28 control system
is attracted to the stable, self-maintaining state at its current cell mass.
A small cell persists in the G1-state until that state disappears at
M  1. Thereafter, the cell executes an oscillation in Cdc28–Clb2
activity, passing through S, G2 and M phases. When Cdc28 activity
falls, as the cell exits mitosis, the cell divides and the newborn progeny
are attracted to the stable G1-state. (B) Checkpoint invoked. At the
restrictive temperature, a cdc24ts cell continues to grow but fails to
make a bud. Consequently, Swe1 is stabilized, and a new self-
maintaining steady state, with intermediate activity of Cdc28–Clb2,
is created. The cell arrests in S-G2 phase for about one mass-doubling
time, until it grows to M  2, where the G2-arrested state disappears.
At this time, the cell adapts to the checkpoint signal, enters mitosis,
and becomes dinucleate. Because the cell does not divide, it stays
in the oscillatory regime and rereplicates its DNA after a very short
G1 phase. The cell reenters mitosis and becomes tetranucleate. The
time between NDs is the period of the underlying oscillatory state,
60 min in the model.
Summary of the model’s predictions and suggestions
The model makes two particularly clear and unexpected
predictions. Regarding Hsl1 kinase, it is evidently involved
in Swe1 degradation because Swe1 is stable in hsl1
(deletion) mutants and Swe1 is degraded more rapidly
in HSL1OP (overproduction) mutants (McMillan et al.,
1999a). The effect is indirect, because Swe1 does not ap-
pear to be a substrate for Hsl1 (Cid et al., 2001). Our
model calculations show that, in order to account for
known dynamical features of the checkpoint mutants in
Table I, Hsl1-dependent modification of Swe1 (whatever
it may be) must also inhibit Swe1 kinase activity by at least
80%. To test this prediction will require reliable assays of
Swe1 kinase activity, which are currently under develop-
ment in Lew’s laboratory (Lew, D.J., personal communica-
tion). Regarding adaptation, it is well known that cdc24ts
cells, which cannot bud at the restrictive temperature, will
nonetheless, after several hours delay, proceed through mi-
tosis and become dinucleate. The model predicts that these
cells will rereplicate their DNA soon after ND. To readily
observe the predicted shortening of G1 phase, cell growth
should be restricted, so that unperturbed daughter cells
have a long G1 period.
The model can be used to predict mutant phenotypes
(such as the many blank spaces under the E columns in Ta-
ble I). Right or wrong, such predictions are handy in design-
ing experiments and extremely valuable in interpreting the
behavior of newly characterized mutants in the context of all
previously studied mutants (Cross, 2003). In addition, the
values assigned to most of the kinetic parameters in Table S2
are predictions. In our experience, similar predictions made
on the cell cycle regulatory system of frog eggs proved to be
remarkably accurate (Marlovits et al., 1998).
The model also points to other experiments that would
provide critical information for refining our understanding
of the morphogenetic checkpoint. For instance, first, we
would like to have precise measurements of the sizes of
clb2 mih1 and clb2 hsl1 cells, because these numbers
would provide strict constraints on the parameters in the
model. Second, we would like to know whether Cdc28–
Clb2 and Mih1 are indeed involved in a positive feedback
loop in budding yeast, or not. The mutant phenotypes in
Table I are insufficient to resolve this issue. Third, the ki-
nase activity of PSwe1 relative to Swe1 should be measured,
to resolve the uncertainty about this ratio. Finally, for fu-
ture modeling purposes, it would be nice to know whether
the MAPK pathway acts by down-regulating Mih1 or up-
regulating Swe1.Mathematical model of the morphogenesis checkpoint | Ciliberto et al. 1253
Morphogenesis checkpoint or size control?
Harvey and Kellogg (2003) have recently challenged the
notion of a “morphogenesis checkpoint,” claiming that
Lew’s data are rather a consequence of a size control check-
point in G2 phase of the budding yeast cell cycle. Because
swe1 cells are slightly smaller than wild-type cells, they
propose that wild-type budding yeast cells, like fission yeast,
have a size requirement for passing from G2 into M phase,
as well as a size requirement for Start (G1-S transition).
Harvey and Kellogg (2003) suggest that the G2 size re-
quirement can be met only by bud growth (not by contin-
ued expansion of the mother cell). Hence, when bud forma-
tion or growth is blocked (by the cdc24ts mutation or by
Latrunculin-A treatment, respectively), the cell finds it dif-
ficult or impossible to meet the G2 size requirement, and so
mitosis is delayed or blocked completely. In this view, there
is no such thing as a morphogenesis checkpoint particular
to budding yeast cells; the phenomenon is just a conse-
quence of a minimum size for the G2-M transition and
growth problems in cells that lack buds.
In Lew’s view and in our model (Fig. 10 A), the primary
size requirement for wild-type cells is at Start (the G1-S
transition). After passing Start, cells normally pass through S
into M (without stopping in G2) and back to G1. A G2-M
size requirement manifests itself only when bud formation is
blocked (Fig. 10 B).
The fundamental difference between these two views is
whether bud failures impair progress toward a minimum
bud size for the G2-M transition (Kellogg’s view) or create a
large threshold for entering into M phase (Lew’s view). Both
views can explain equally well the observation that actin dis-
ruption (by treatment with Latrunculin-A) delays mitotic
entry indefinitely. The two views give very different ac-
counts of cell cycle mutants. In Lew’s picture, when a bud
fails to form, a surveillance mechanism, involving Hsl1 and
Mpk1, creates a stable G2-arrested steady state (Fig. 10 B),
by activating Swe1 and inhibiting Mih1. The cdc24ts cell
continues to grow at the restrictive temperature, but it must
now satisfy a large size requirement for passing from G2 into
M phase. After a characteristic delay, the cell enters M phase
and becomes dinucleate.
In Kellogg’s picture, it is difficult to explain why cdc24ts
cells, which fail to make a bud at all, are only delayed in en-
tering mitosis. Why is not mitosis delayed indefinitely, as in
Latrunculin-treated cells? In this case, some fraction of
mother cell growth must count toward meeting the G2-M
transition size. Kellogg’s view also cannot explain why
mih1 causes strikingly different effects in CDC24 and
cdc24ts backgrounds (no delay in cell cycle progression and
cell cycle block, respectively).
As we have shown by mathematical modeling, the concept
of a morphogenesis checkpoint (with the assumption that
Hsl1 down-regulates Swe1 activity) is compatible with most
of the observed phenotypes of cdc24ts cells. Just like check-
points for damaged or unreplicated DNA or for spindle de-
fects, the morphogenesis checkpoint responds to a signal
(bud failure) by arresting the cell cycle engine in a stable
steady state. The arrest can be bypassed if the cell grows large
enough, which is a common feature of other checkpoint
mechanisms (Toczyski et al., 1997).
Materials and methods
Simulations
The differential equations (Table S1) were solved numerically using XPP,
which is software developed by Bard Ermentrout and freely downloadable
from his FTP site (http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html). We used
the CVODE integration method provided by XPP, with the default settings
for the integration parameters, except relative tolerance  absolute toler-
ance  3 10 16. The model’s “.ode” file (input to XPP) is provided as on-
line supplemental material (see Ciliberto_XPP.zip), available at http://
www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200306139/DC1.
Parameter search
To investigate the sensitivity of the model to kinetic constants in the Swe1
box (Fig. 2), we chose two parameters from the box to vary simulta-
neously. For each pair of parameter values, we computed the model’s pre-
dictions of the data reported in Table I. Each simulated data point (call it
Rsim, R for results) is checked against the corresponding experimental ob-
servation (call it Rexp). If | Rsim Rexp | / Rexp 0.2, we assume that the sim-
ulation “fits” the experimental result, otherwise it does not.
In Table I are reported data for 14 different genotypes, the wild type plus
13 mutants. Some genotypes are characterized by more than one experi-
mental observation: we assume that a simulated genotype fits an observed
genotype only if all of its characteristics have been reproduced to within
20%. For example, in GAP-SWE1 two conditions have to be matched:
ND in cells arrested with -factor has to occur between 60 and 90 min, and
ND in cdc24ts cells arrested in -factor has to occur between 141.6 and
94.4 min. Because we do not know precisely how much larger clb2 hsl1
cells are than clb2 mih1 cells, we assume that the simulated result is sat-
isfactory if clb2 hsl1 is at least 15% larger than clb2 mih1. A success-
ful simulation should fit all 14 genotypes. Because clb2 mih1 and clb2
hsl1 are grouped together (the experimental result is the ratio of their
sizes), the number of independent genotypes is 13.
Summarizing, parameter search is performed in the following way: ex-
perimental data reproduced in Table I are computed for each parameter
set. Simulations are compared with experimental data for each of the ge-
notypes. If all data characterizing a particular genotype are within 20%
of experimental results, that particular genotype fits experimental data.
When every genotype has been computed, a natural number in the inter-
val [0,13] is associated with the parameter set, according to the number of
genotypes that have been successfully reproduced.
