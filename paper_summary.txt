# Summary:
The Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM) is a collection of multiparametric MRI images, volumetric assessments, molecular data, and survival details for glioblastoma patients who underwent total or near-total enhancing tumor resection. The dataset aims to address the limitations of public MRI repositories by providing expert-corrected segmentations of tumor subregions and follow-up studies, enabling researchers to study recurrence patterns and develop new diagnostic and prognostic models. By publicly disseminating this dataset, the scientific community can scrutinize recurrence patterns in patients who have experienced gross total or near-total resection, facilitating the development of novel registration and segmentation algorithms tailored for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans.

# Background and Significance:
Context: Glioblastoma Research Challenge
Glioblastoma, the most prevalent primary brain tumor, poses a significant challenge in clinical management due to its dismal prognosis despite extensive research efforts.
Research Problem - Diagnostic Accuracy and Prognostic Models
Despite advances in medical image processing techniques and artificial intelligence-based algorithms, existing public MRI repositories have limitations, including preoperative studies with diverse resection categories, limited expert annotations, and structural sequences of MRI modalities. These constraints hinder the development of accurate diagnostic models for glioblastoma.
Key Literature: Public MRI Repositories
Public data sources, such as The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge dataset, have supplied valuable research data in the field. However, these resources primarily focus on preoperative studies with limited annotations and structural sequences.
Importance of the Study - Contribution to Glioblastoma Research
The proposed "Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset (RHUH-GBM)" aims to address the research problem by providing a novel dataset with multiparametric MRI images captured at three critical junctures: preoperative, early postoperative, and follow-up examinations. This dataset complements existing public resources and enables researchers to focus on recurrence patterns in patients who have experienced gross total or near-total resection. The study's significance lies in its potential to facilitate the development of novel registration and segmentation algorithms tailored for postoperative and follow-up MRI scans, ultimately contributing to improved diagnostic accuracy and prognostic models for glioblastoma.

# Methods:
* **Patient Population:**
	+ Consecutive patients with WHO grade 4 astrocytoma who underwent surgery between January 2018 and December 2022
	+ Inclusion criteria: GTR or NTR, availability of MRI studies at three time points (preoperative, early postoperative, and follow-up), and receipt of adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy following the Stupp protocol
* **Clinical, Pathological, and Imaging Data:**
	+ Obtained from electronic medical records, including age, sex, histopathological diagnosis, pre- and postoperative KPS, IDH status, use of operative adjuncts, volumetric assessment of the extent of resection, presence of postoperative neurological deficits, details of chemotherapy and radiotherapy received, and overall survival and progression-free survival times
* **Image Preprocessing:**
	+ Images retrieved from PACS in DICOM format and converted to NIfTI format using dicom2niix tool
	+ T1ce scans registered to SRI24 anatomical atlas space using FLIRT tool
	+ Other MRI sequences (T1w, T2w, FLAIR) registered to the transformed T1ce scan
	+ Brain extraction from co-registered scans using Synthstrip deep learning tool
	+ Intensity Z-scoring normalization performed using CaPTk tools
* **Tumor Subregions Segmentations:**
	+ Preprocessed images used for generating computer-aided segmentations using Deep-Medic
	+ Three labels obtained, corresponding to necrosis, peritumoral signal alteration (including edema and non-enhancing tumor), and enhancing tumor
	+ Segmentations reviewed and manually corrected by two expert neurosurgeons

# Results:
A study was conducted on patients with glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. The following are the key findings:
* **Demographics:**
	+ Average age: 63 ± 9 years
	+ Male to female ratio: 70% male, 30% female
* **Surgery and Resection:**
	+ Mean extent of resection (EOR): 99.31 ± 1.36%
	+ Gross total resection rate: 67.5% (27 patients)
	+ Near-total resection rate: 32.5% (13 patients)
* **Tumor Volumes and IDH Status:**
	+ Mean preoperative contrast-enhancing tumor volume: 34.99 ± 26.59
	+ Mean postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor volume: 0.23 ± 0.47
	+ IDH-mutated cases: 10% (4 patients)
	+ IDH wild-type cases: 90% (36 patients)
* **Survival Outcomes:**
	+ Median overall survival: 364 days
	+ Median progression-free survival: 198 days

# Discussion:
The current public MRI collections for glioblastoma patients have contributed significantly to advancements in the field, but they primarily focus on preoperative studies and often lack information on tumor resection extent or segmentations. The Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (Ivy GAP) collection offers longitudinal studies, but not all include early postoperative assessments.
The recent Multi-parametric MRI scans for de novo glioblastoma patients from the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPENN-GBM) and The University of California San Francisco Preoperative Diffuse Glioma MRI (UCSF-PDGM) collections contain expert-refined segmentations, but they have limitations, such as limited follow-up studies in UPENN-GBM and only preoperative studies for grade 4 astrocytoma cases in UCSF-PDGM.
The newly proposed HURH-GBM collection fills this gap by incorporating early postoperative studies and recurrence scans. Its expert-corrected segmentations can facilitate investigations into tumor recurrence patterns, particularly in patients with gross total resection. The provided labels also serve as ground truths for developing segmentation and coregistration algorithms targeting postoperative and follow-up studies.
Key Interpretation:
* Current public MRI collections have limitations in focusing on preoperative studies.
* The HURH-GBM collection fills the gap by incorporating early postoperative studies and recurrence scans, making it a valuable resource for investigating tumor recurrence patterns.
Implications:
* The availability of early postoperative studies and segmentations in HURH-GBM can facilitate investigations into tumor recurrence patterns.
* The provided labels can serve as ground truths for developing segmentation and coregistration algorithms targeting postoperative and follow-up studies.
